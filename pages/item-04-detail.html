        <p>This Diefenbunker project is a great example to show small local business whats possible when you invest in design.  After spending time researching alternative museum logos and brand identities I noticed most have moved towards more minimalist logos with strong abstract shapes that some might say resemble street sign iconography.
This trend is what inspired the direction I took with the new straightforward Diefenbunker logo.

Not only is it very memorable at any size but it visualizes the cold war in a tasteful way never seen or used before unlike other global cold war museums. Its a visual representation of a nuclear atom which is what the cold war essentially revolved around.

I made sure to remain subtle and unoffensive with my design choices as I found that using more graphic imagery such as bombs or other relative visuals appear too intense or aggressive. I also followed these guidelines when choosing colours where I found these light desaturated blues symbolized the cold and tense subject matter.</p>
