        <p>This fully flushed out re-brand shows my capabilities to work with real life clients and sell a difficult unknown product such as powercore with my design skills.

  I also had to use team and communication skills throughout this project. We utilized online tools to stay organized and communicated every minute task that had to be finished. We also implemented strict deadlines that made sure everyone was pulling their weight.</p>
